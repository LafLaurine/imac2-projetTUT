<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The purpose of this project is to detect deepfakes videos thanks to several methods that already exist ([MesoNet](https://github.com/DariusAf/MesoNet), [CapsuleForensics](https://github.com/nii-yamagishilab/Capsule-Forensics-v2)) and include it to the [WeVerify InVID plugin](https://github.com/AFP-Medialab/we-verify-app) project.

This repository includes sources that can be run with the help of Docker tools, to train neural networks and/or use them to detect deepfakes.


### Built With

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Simplify and Accelerate App Development
* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) - A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications
